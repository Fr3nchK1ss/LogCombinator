# LogCombinator
Given log files selected through the QML UI, LogCombinator creates one single log file where lines are ordered according to their timestamps.

## Build
Open the CMakeLists.txt with QtCreator, then follow the normal Qt build flow.

## Test files
The test files are file1.log and file2.log
An ISO timestamp looks like yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss[.mmm]
